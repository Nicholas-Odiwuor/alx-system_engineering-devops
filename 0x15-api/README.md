# 0x15. API

## Description
This project focuses on creating and working with APIs using Python. The objective is to understand how to interact with external services and data through API endpoints, manage HTTP requests, and handle JSON responses.

## Requirements

### General
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Python version:** 3.8.5
- **Style guide:** pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- **All files must:**
  - End with a new line
  - Begin with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Have imports organized in alphabetical order
  - Be executable
  - Have their length tested using `wc`
  - Include module documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
  - Use `get` to access dictionary values by key
  - Not execute code when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`)

## Project Structure
- All Python scripts are located at the root of the project directory.
- Each script is designed to interact with different aspects of an API, demonstrating various techniques for managing requests and responses.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8.5 installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run each script individually to see how they interact with the API.
   ```bash
   ./script_name.py
