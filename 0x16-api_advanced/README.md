# 0x16. API Advanced

## Description
This project focuses on advanced API usage, specifically using the **Reddit API**. The tasks will involve making API calls, handling pagination, parsing JSON responses, making recursive API calls, and sorting data.

Mastering these concepts is essential for technical interviews and real-world applications, as APIs are widely used to interact with external services and fetch structured data.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Read API documentation to find relevant endpoints.
- Use an API with pagination.
- Parse JSON results from an API response.
- Make recursive API calls.
- Sort a dictionary by value.

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3 (version 3.4.3)`
- All files should end with a **new line**
- The first line of all your files must be exactly:
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```
- Libraries imported in Python files must be organized in **alphabetical order**
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder, is **mandatory**
- Your code should follow **PEP 8** style guidelines
- All your files must be **executable**
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All modules should have documentation, which can be checked using:
  ```sh
  python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
  ```
- You **must use** the `Requests` module to send HTTP requests to the **Reddit API**

## Background Context
Understanding and effectively using APIs is a crucial skill for developers. APIs are commonly encountered in technical interviews, ranging from simple data retrieval to complex recursive functions and data manipulation.

The **Reddit API** is an excellent platform for API practice. It offers various endpoints, many of which do not require authentication, making it a great tool for learning. Gaining expertise in API calls will not only enhance your interview performance but also prove useful in real-world scenarios and personal projects.

## Installation & Usage
To run the scripts in this project, ensure you have **Python 3** installed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

### Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install requests
```

### Running a Script
```sh
./script_name.py
```
